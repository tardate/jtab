<h1>jTab - Guitar Chord and Tab Notation for the Web</h1>
<p>
jTab is a javascript-based library that allows you to easily render arbitrary guitar chord and tabulature (tab)
notation on the web. Automatically. It works in most modern browsers that support javascript, CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG) - 
for example, Firefox 3+, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.

<a name="about"><h2>About jTab</h2></a>
<p>
Guitar tab is all over the internet, but it is usually in either a fixed/non-interactive form, or painstaking ASCII format.
jTab is an open source, javascript-based library that lets you change that. It automatically converts a simple text notation 
to a web-friendly graphical presentation on the fly. 
</p>
<p>
You can use it to post snippets on your blog, host user contributions on a web site, or just for personal transcription purposes.
It is also scriptable with javascript for more sophisticated applications.
</p>
<p>
Technically, jTab is a javascript-based library that renders notation using CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG).
It works in most modern browsers that support javascript, CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG) - 
for example: Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer (see <a href="#browsers">browser support</a>).
</p>


<a name="examples"><h2>Live Examples</h2></a>
<p>
Show don't tell! So before going further, here are some examples of jTab in action. 
More examples are available <a href="examples.htm">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Interactive/Explicit Rendering using Javascript</h3>
<p>
jTab can be used to render notation in real-time using Javascript. This could be based on user input (like here), or with the notation feed
being generated or retrieved from some system or web service.
</p>
<span>Try it out. Enter a phrase here (see <a href="#notation">notation</a> for help):</span>
<input id="user_notation" size="40"><input type="button" value="jTab this!" onclick="jtab.render($('#tab'),$('#user_notation').val());">
<div id="tab"><i>jTab will render your phrase here</i></div>

<script type='text/javascript'>
  $('#user_notation').keyup(function(e){
     jtab.render($('#tab'),$(this).val());
  });
</script>

<h3>Implicit Rendering using CSS</h3>
<p>
jTab implicitly renders tab notation on a web page that is contained in blocks marked with the special class name 'jtab'.
This can be used for posting transcriptions to your blog for example - just include jTab in your blog template then 
when posting you don't need to remember anything else except to set the class name on your notation.
</p>

<p>Here, a chord phrase is written directly into the web page..</p>
<div class="jtab chordonly"> E / / / | A7 / B7 / || </div>
<p>Here's an example combining chords and tab notation..</p>
<div class="jtab">Bm $3 4 4h5p3h4 5 $2 3 5 7 7h8p7 5/7 | A $4 7 9 $3 7 6 $5 9 $4 7h9 7 $5 9\7 5/7 | </div>
<p>Or just tab notation..</p>
<div class="jtab tabonly">$4.7/9.$3.6/8.$2.5/7 9p7 $2.9.$3.9.$4.9 </div>


<a name="notation"><h2>Notation Reference</h2></a>
<p>
If you find this a little dry to read,
see the <a href="examples.htm">examples</a> page which demostrate all these features and more.
</p>
<h3>Chord Notation</h3>
<p>
Chord notation is quite conventional e.g. C Gm F#7 Db. 
</p>  
  <ul>
  <li>The root note (A..G) must be uppercase</li>
  <li>Seperate every item with spaces</li>
  <li><strong>#</strong> indicates sharp</li>
  <li><strong>b</strong> (lowercase B) indicates flat</li>
  <li><strong>m</strong> (lowercase) indicates minor</li>
  <li><strong>maj</strong> (lowercase) indicates major</li>
  <li><strong>sus</strong> (lowercase) indicates suspended</li>
  <li><strong>dim</strong> (lowercase) indicates diminished</li>
  <li><strong>aug</strong> (lowercase) indicates augmented</li>
  <li><strong>add</strong> (lowercase) indicates extensions</li>
  <li>Variations on the root chord: m, 6, m6, 69, 7, m7, maj7, 7b5, 7#5, m7b5, 
  7b9, 9, m9, maj9, add9, 13, sus2, sus4, dim, dim7, aug</li> 
  <li><strong>/</strong> indicates repeat of the previous chord</li>
  <li><strong>|</strong> is a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)" target="_blank">bar line</a></li>
  <li><strong>||</strong> is an ending bar line</li>
  </ul>
<p>
jTab also supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_chord#CAGED_major_chords" target="_blank">CAGED major chord notation</a>.
This is a convenient method for indicating major chords at various positions on the fretboard.
</p>  
  <ul>
  <li>May be applied to all chords</li>
  <li>Position is indicated by following the chord with a colon and the position number 1,2,3...</li>
  <li>e.g. C:1, Cm7:5, Eaug:2, Dsus2:3</li>
  </ul>
<p>
A full chart of chords supported by jTab as available <a href="jtab-chordchart.htm">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Custom Chord Notation</h3>

<p>jTab also supports custom chord notation, where the frets and fingers for any arbitrary chord can be explicitly defined.
	<pre>%Fret/Finger.Fret/Finger.Fret/Finger.Fret/Finger.Fret/Finger.Fret/Finger[Name]</pre>
	<ul>
	<li>Frets: Numeric position on the fretboard</li>
	<li>Fingers: 1,2,3,4,T (uppercase)</li>
	<li>For open strings, enter: 0/0</li>
	<li>Muted or not played strings: X/X or x/x (case-insensitive)</li>
	<li>Name: enclose the name of the chord in square brackets (name is optional, to leave it out just exclude the brackets)</li>
	</ul>
	You must always include all six strings.	
</p>
<p>Here's an example:
	<pre>%7/2.X/X.7/3.7/4.6/1.X/X[Bm7b5]</pre>
	<div class="jtab chordonly">%7/2.X/X.7/3.7/4.6/1.X/X[Bm7b5]</div>	
</p>


<h3>Tab Notation</h3> 
<p> 
Representing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature" target="_blank">tab notation</a> is little special to jTab, 
but aims to be as simple as possible.
</p>
<p>
Basic entry of notes on a single string is done by setting the string and then following with the notation (separated by spaces).
  <ul>
  <li>Indicating the string is done with the dollar sign ("$") followed by the string number (1-6, high to low). 
  e.g. $2 is the B string in standard tuning</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use the string tuning instead of string number, EADGBe low to high in standard tuning.
  e.g. $B is the 2nd string in standard tuning.</li>
  <li>Then you can in fact follow with anything you like - fret position, slides ( / \ ) hammerons (h), pulloffs (p) etc (just avoid uppercase characters to avoid confusion with chords)</li>
  <li>Examples:
     <ul>
      <li>$2 0 1 3 (a simple three note sequence on the B string)</li>
      <li>$2 0 1 3 $1 0 1 3/5 (a sequence of notes starting on the B string, continuing on the high E string, finishing with a slide to A)</li>
      <li>$B 0 1 3 $e 0 1 3/5 (same, but using string notes instead of numbers)</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

</p>
<p>
What about more than one note at the same time?
To handle multiple notes played on different strings, join all the individual string notation together with periods (".")
</p>
<p>Examples:
   <ul>
    <li>$3.6.$2.5h7 $1 5 $2 7 (start with two notes on G and B strings followed by a hammeron and two individual notes)</li>
    <li>$4.7/9.$3.6/8.$2.5/7 9p7 $2.9.$3.9.$4.9 (three notes across D,G,B strings with a slide up two steps and a twist)</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
Tab for a whole or partial chord can be easier to enter as a full six-string block.
A shorthand is possible if you want to enter notes across all 6 strings:
   <ul>
    <li>Below the 10th fret, just concatenate the six string fret positions (from low string to high) e.g. 022100 is E chord at the nut.</li>
    <li>Periods are required to separate each string e.g. 8.10.10.9.8.8 is C chord at the 8th fret (which can also be written as C:4 in CAGED notation)</li>
    <li>substitute an X or x for mute strings e.g. X02220 is an A chord</li>
   </ul>
  
</p>


<h3>Mixing Chord &amp; Tab Notation</h3> 
<p> 
You can mix chord and tab notation without restriction in the one phrase. 
This will result in a tab line being drawn, with chord charts above where relevant.
</p>


<h3>Rendering Options: Color</h3> 
<p> 
jTab will render using the color and background-color styles of the enclosing HTML element.
</p>


<h3>Rendering Options: Size</h3> 
<p> 
jTab currently only renders in a single size. 
Having the ability to control the size of the rendered tab is something we'd like to get into a future update.
</p>




<a name="download"><h2>Downloading/obtaining jTab </h2></a>
<p>
jTab is open source and free to use. You are welcome to use and reuse it however you like.
</p>
<p>
The project home page is at <a href="http://jtab.tardate.com/">http://jtab.tardate.com</a>
</p>
<p>
The master source code repository is on github (<a href="http://github.com/tardate/jtab/tree/master">http://github.com/tardate/jtab/tree/master</a>). 
You will always find the latest version here and be able to <a href="#feedback">contribute</a> to the project yourself.
</p>
<p>
There is also a version located at <a href="http://jtab.tardate.com">jtab.tardate.com</a> that you can point to directly (although performance may suffer a little). 
</p>

<a name="install"><h2>How To Install jTab on your Web Page or Site</h2></a>
<h3>1. Include jTab Javascript files</h3>
<p>
jTab is provided as a single javascript source file (jtab.js) that needs to be included on your page.
It depends on three additional libraries that must also be included: <a href="http://www.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, 
LowPro (included), and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" target="_blank">Rapha&euml;l</a> (raphael.js). 
Compatible versions of these libraries located along with jtab.js, or if you are already using a version of these libraries
you probably do not need to include them again.
</p>
<p>
You can <a href="#download">download</a> these files and use them locally on your own site.
There is also a version located at http://jtab.tardate.com that you can point to directly (although performance may suffer a little). 
The example below shows how to pull the files direct from tardate.com.

</pre>
<p>
Note the optional jtab-helper.css file. It is used to preset jtab region heights to avoid screen layout resizing during rendering. 
More information about that <a href="#help">here</a>. 
</p>



<h3>2. Performing Implicit Rendering</h3>
Seriously, how easy is this? Just put your notation text inside any block tag (e.g. DIV) and give it the class name "jtab"..
<pre>
&lt;div class="jtab"&gt; E / / / | Am / B / || &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The HTML code above produces the following (view the source of this page to prove it yourself!):
</p>
<div class="jtab chordonly"> E / / / | Am / B / || </div>

<h3>3. Explicit Rendering with Scripting</h3>
<p>
You can script the rendering of a guitar tab phrase into any HTML block using a line of javascript to call the jtab.render() function.
jtab.render() takes two parameters. The first is the ID or name of the HTML element to render the tab into, and the second is the actual line of tab notation (a string).
Obviously, you can bring all your javascripting expertise to bear: the tab notation may be preset in the page, pulled from a database, the result of a web services call, entered by the user, or ... 
</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id="mytab"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jtab.render($('#mytab'),'Am7 C');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Actual result is this:
</p>

<div id="mytab"><i>jTab rendering here..</i></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    jtab.render($('#mytab'),'Am7 C');
</script>




<a name="help"><h2>Troubleshooting and Tips</h2></a>

<h3>Page layout jitters while rendering jTab</h3>
<p>
jTab automatically resize HTML DOM objects to fit the notation it is rendering.
Because of this, page layout main jitter around as the page elements are changing size.
To avoid this, you can pre-size your jtab elements to avoid the resizing.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, the standard height of jTab renderings is as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Chord and tab diagram: 218px</li>
  <li>Chord-only diagram: 118px</li>
  <li>Tab-only diagram: 100px</li>
  </ul>
Note that width is indeterminate - it depends on your notation.
</p>
<p>  
An optional stylesheet is included in the jTab kit (css/jtab-helper.css)and can be included in you pages:
</p>
<pre>&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="http://jtab.tardate.com/css/jtab-helper.css"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The stylesheet presets the jtab class to the maximum possible height, and provides class modifiers if you know you
will only have tab or chord elements present.
</p>
<pre>&lt;div class="jtab"&gt;(pre-sized for chord and tab)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="jtab chordonly"&gt;(pre-sized for chord only)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="jtab tabonly"&gt;(pre-sized for tab only)&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Inline blocks and IE</h3>
<p>
Implicit rendering with normally inline blocks (like a SPAN tag) can be an issue in IE. 
Rendering a series of SPAN tags may result in the guitar tabs being written over each other (it seems IE does not automatically
adjust the size of the block to fit the rendered guitar tab, whereas Firefox does for example).
</p>
<p>
Solution: just avoid inline blocks. Hold your guitar tab in a DIV tag for instance. 
</p>

<h3>Implicit rendering isn't happening?</h3>
<p>
jTab hooks the window.onload function in order to "automagically" do its implicit, CSS-based rendering. 
It plays well with other onload handlers installed <i>before</i> jTab, however if anything on your page
installs an onload handler <i>after</i> jTab, it may overwrite the jTab hook and prevent it running.
</p>
<p>
Solution 1: restructure your page so that jtab.js is included after anything else that may interfere with it.
<br/>
Solution 2: include an explicit call to the rendering function at the end of your page:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jtab.renderimplicit();
    &lt;/script&gt;   
</pre>

<a name="limitations"><h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
jTab is a new project, so there are definitely some things it can't do at the moment.
See the <a href="http://github.com/tardate/jtab/issues" target="_blank">issues list</a> on github for all currently open issues. 
Some of the main things to note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chord diagrams don't render a barre symbol or other common annotations.</li>
<li>No explicit support for alternate tunings</li>
<li>Currently only six-string beasts. No bass, lutes, mandolins, banjoes etc etc.. sorry ;-) </li>
</ul>


<a name="browsers"><h3>Browser Support</h3></a>
<p>
jTab works in most modern browsers that support javascript, CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG) - 
for example, Firefox 3+, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
Internet Explorer is a little problemmatic however. IE7 is the most reliable, IE6 has some imperfect rendering,
and as of writing IE8 is exhibiting very poor performance rendering SVG (in the order of 10x slower than Firefox/Chome,
and much slower than IE7).
